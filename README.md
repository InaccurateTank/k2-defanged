So Krastorio 2 adds a module that overhauls firearm combat.  It's a compelling change from stock with bullets being modeled as actual projectiles rather than instant hits.  This module however *completely* screws up the damage curve.  Damage of standard rounds is increased to 10 (the same as base game AP) and even with the cost increases it's still relivent through all of lategame.  This doesn't even begin to touch the issues with the AMR curve in relation to the SMG.

This mod aims to correct that issue by modifying the damage values for the rounds.  Overall the curve has been shifted back down to about where Vanilla places it.  Theres a gulf between AP and Uranium that is intended to be filled by midline laser defenses and flamethrowers.  AMR DPS has been shifted very slightly down but damage per shot has been drastically increased.  Cannons still take top slot in per-shot damage but, seeing as how I tend not to use them that much, I can't tell for certain if it's balanced.
